# Adding New Payments

The *Payments* module is an optional value-added service for tracking vendor invoices and payments received.

Payments allow you to view payments that you've received, view missing payments, record new payments, and forecast incoming payments. Payments may or may not have an end date - they can be indefinite, or may end when a contract expires. Additionally, recurring payments are not required. **Note: For one-time payments, it is important that you specify the start date.**

## Adding a One-Time Payment

1. Select the *Add Payment* quick action button.
2. Enter the *Check/ACH Number*. 
3. Enter the *Check Amount*. 
4. Enter the *Payment Date*. **Note: Depending on your business rules, you may want to backdate the date to the last day of the previous month.**
5. Select a provider from the *Provider* dropdown menu.
6. If applicable, select a payment period. **Note: Setting a payment period attempts to match the payment schedules for your transactions to the same period.** [Remove this and reword for Recurring Payments]
7. If you did not select a payment period, enter a payment period in the *Start* and *End* fields. 
8. If applicable, enter any relevant notes in the *Payment Memo* field.
9. In the **Transaction** section, select the *Property*. The corresponding agreement and schedule will populate in the *Agreement* and *Schedule* fields. **Note: You can create a new Payment Schedule by selecting the *+* symbol to the right of the default Schedule.**
10. Enter or adjust an amount in the *Amount* field.
11. If applicable, enter or adjust any relevant notes in the *Memo* field.
