# Reports 

*Reports* is a module that ties together cross-module data over specified time periods.

The *Reports* module shows you several types of reports that may be useful to you, including *Financial*, *Month End Portal*, and *Gross Revenue*. 

## Financial Reports

**Note: For *Financial Reports*, data does not populate by default. You must select a date range in order to generate a report. 

1. Select a saved report to view or select the button next to *Saved Reports* and select *Create New Report*. 
2. Enter a name for your report and select *Create Report*. 
3. Choose how you want to group your results by (*Property*, *Client*, *Provider*, *Ownership Group*, *Management Company*, or *Legacy Account Representatives.*)
4. Specify an exact date range or select an interval for the payment period you want to see in the report. The valures for *Property*, *Client*, *Provider*, *Ownership Group*, *Management Company*, and *Legacy Account Representatives* at the top of the screen will update.

10. If applicable, adjust settings for the report by selecting *Settings*. Here, you can deselect any unwanted columns and reorder the way they appear in the report. Select *Apply* when you are done or *Reset to Default* if you do not want to keep your changes.
11. Your results will appear at the bottom of the screen. 

## Month-End Reports

*Month-End* reports allow you to check and create a report for where money was sent and what for. An e-mail notification is generated which generates the PDF report and is sent to the requestor(s) or assigned contact(s) for the associated properties.

<!--- [Separate documentation for Month-End Portal. Two ways to send payments: check and report for what money was for. Alternate/preferred: ACH transfer (bank to bank). Nothing is physically sent, just an e-mail with a notification that money will be sent/has been sent. Has PDF attached. Generates that PDF and sends e-mail to person designated to receive it for those properties. Property: 1:1, sends e-mail to all people associated with it. ACH Contact: Sends all reports to one contact that they're attached to instead of just one.] --->

## Gross Revenue Reports

*Gross Revenue* reports allow you to see all payments for each client that arrived within a specific date range. You can export this report to Excel on demand.
